This repository contains examples of how to connect to a remote spatial PostgreSQL + PostGIS database using R, MS Access, ArcGIS, and QGIS. It was developed in 2019 as a demo/prototype for a potential project. My goal with this prototype was to illustrate the advantages of using a database server over local databases. I am uploading it here in case some people find the information helpful (as well as for my own future reference).

The original test database was hosted using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), but I eventually disabled it when it was no longer needed. Therefore, the examples will no longer run.

Additionally, given the age the demo, some of the instructions and code may be outdated and should be taken with a grain of salt.
